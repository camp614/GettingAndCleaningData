## Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (Mean & SD Subset) ##

This data set is derived from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" which can be found at the following website: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

This data set transforms the original by selecting only the Mean and Standard Deviation values of direct "time"- and "frequency"-related measurements.  Additionally, the data is further transformed by calculating the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
